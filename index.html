    <p class="abstract">
      Orb Farm is a Web-browser designed to simulate an Ecosystem inside a jar,
      the goal of this interaction is to grow and nurture a living environment
      in a virtual reality world. Meanwhile, Limb Body Beat, is an experience by
      Adult Swim, a beat generation web-site that generates beats by using a
      ragdoll.

    <p class="information-design">1. Information Design</p>
    <p class="information-design">
      Orb Farm is a design is very minimalist in it own way, it styles is
      surrounding pixelated Retro Design look like from the 90s, one of the
      major notices is an empty circular pixel tank, and a clear control label
      on the top left of the sites with word like “Fish” or “Water”, and a
      O2/CO2 meter next to the buttons.
    </p>
    <p class="information-design" id="limb-body-beat">
      Limb Body Beat design is the opposite, its style is more 3D environment
      yet feels messy. It creates a dark, grimy and chaotic vibe about the
      worlds that you are inside of, however it still brings us the vibe that we
      want to explore and understand more about this world that they’re
      building.
    </p>
    <p class="information-design" id="conclusion">
      The Design of Orb Farm is more relaxing, giving the chilling vibe in a
      family and friendly style, mostly more about directing and delivering
      clear messages of sorts. . Limb Body Beat is more of expression and
      exploration, it makes the users more curious of what is going on, the
      design itself taking an immersive experience, exposing itself more to the
      environment surrounding it.
    </p>
    <p class="mapping">2. Mapping</p>
    <p class="mapping">
      The interface is quite simple by using the actions of clicking and
      dragging, by doing that you spawn in the living organism to fill up the
      tank. You can easily track and navigate around, the Co2/o2 meters is
      visually in real-time showing you clearly of how you manage it. The one
      thing I like is the forward buttons next to the meter to speed up the
      process of the time.
    </p>
    <p class="mapping">
      Limb Body Beat is quite immersive, not only the interaction is by clicking
      on the beat-grid, but the users can drag the ragdoll around, by click and
      hold the surrounding space, the users can navigate around the environment,
      the ragdoll can also be drag to the cube the being projecting out to make
      some type of beat by collision.
    </p>
    <p class="mapping" id="conclusion">
      The mapping in Orb Farm is more structured, and more simplified, aiming
      for guidance and easily understanding. Limb Body Beat is more about
      exploration, more exposure and taking curiosity to become the users own
      research.
    </p>
    <p class="Characterisation">3. Characterisation</p>
    <p class="Characterisation">
      Orb Farm takes its design with a calm visual feeling, especially the
      background and the whole visual is based mostly on a simple look, nothing
      too complicated, the design is aiming for educational purposes.
    </p>
    <p class="Characterisation">
      Adult Swims is really well known for a dark, edgy content. Limb Body Beat
      design is chaotic, sometimes making everything confused, that is why the
      whole experience felt weird and off, but because of the chaotic create
      interactive toy, where it still provokes users to continue to experience
      and keep exploring it.
    </p>
    <p class="Characterisation" id="conclusion">
      Orb Farm is more about well structure and strongly more about simplifying
      making things more understandable and easy to learn. Limb Body Beat is
      more of a chaotic, complexity design, yet attracting the interaction into
      curiosity.

    <div class="container">
      <div class="feedback-orb-farm">
        For Orb Farm I think the CO2/O2 meter is a great feedback, because it
        represents a healthbar, like it gives a continuation of feedback that
        rapidly changes and keeps the core of what it needs to be. It is a case
        of learning and experimenting trying to balance the ecosystem's life in
        the simulation
      </div>
      <div class="feedback-limb-body-beat">
        For Limb Body Beat, I think the interaction between the ragdoll and the
        beat is the feedback of the whole interactive, by collision to each
        other, they both combine to generate sounds to make a beat. You don’t
        even get the messages or anything, only the ragdoll and the beat note is
        your feedback.
